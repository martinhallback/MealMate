      <div class="AboutUsText">
        <p>Students are looking for both affordable and nutritious food that is quick to prepare. With our offering,
          students have the opportunity to choose from different dishes at low prices that can be acquired swiftly.
          This promotes both students who feel they cook a little too much food for themselves, seeking an extra source
          of income and those who think they do not have time to cook their own. The vision for this idea is to increase
          the living standards of the student by making their daily life more efficient.</p>
